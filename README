Webwork Problem Server
-----------------------------------

1) Setup
    a) Change permissions for directories writable by server
        chmod -R 777 htdocs/tmp
        chmod -R 777 tmp


2) Configuration
    The main changes in configuration are in the top of global.conf and in problemserver.apache2-config
    In problemserver.apache2-config:
        $problemserver_dir  = The root directory where the problemserver is installed.
        $pg_dir             = The root directory where the pg is installed.
        The Alias command should be changed to point to the root directory of problemserver + "/htdocs"
            ex) Alias /problemserver_files /home/you/problemserver/htdocs
        The Directory line should be changed to be the same as the second part of the Alias command above
            ex) <Directory /home/you/problemserver/htdocs>
    In global.conf
        $problemServer{host}	= The host the problem server is installed on
            ex) "http://www.example.org";
        $pg_dir              	= Same as the $pg_dir for problemserver.apache2-config
	$problemServerDirs{root}= Same as the $problemserver_dir for problemserver.apache2-config

        Note: Make sure the paths to the external programs are set correctly for your system.
        Optionally: On line 163 you can add more paths to look for macro files.

    Finally you need to add an Include statement to your apache2.conf file. This should be located in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf under most systems.
        ex) Include /home/you/problemserver/conf/problemserver.apache2-config

3) Restart Apache2
